Spam Mail Detection using Naive Bayes Algorithm
Description

This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect whether an email is spam or not using the Naive Bayes Algorithm. The Naive Bayes algorithm is a popular classification technique that is well-suited for spam detection due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data and make predictions based on the probability of a message being spam or not.
